Suggestions:

 1) USB dongle with OpenTRV listener/sender (on OpenTRV channel) spitting out on serial.

 2) OpenTRV send/rcv JeeLib channel/frames.





 3) (Ken B): BLE dongle (eg worn on the person) to act as personal thermostat override,
    could have matching RX on REV7 I2CEXT, with (say) listening 1s in 15s or 120s.
    (Eg exactly like the IR beacon suggested by Tony B.)
