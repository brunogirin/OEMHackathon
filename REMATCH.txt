Rematch in September.


Aim to have done:

 1) OEM Secure Frame

  * Gives OEM a secure over-the-air format.
  * Radio module neutral
  * Fits in a 64-byte frame
  * Authentication and encryption
  * Application neutral for interop
  * Runs on a microcontroller (eg ATmega328P)

 2) Interchangeable REV11 and emonTH, common design, cost reduction.

 3) Andrew Lindsay LoRa board talk to OEM.

 4) Martin Harazinov 3-relay board driven by RFduino/RFM69/BLE.

    (41mm from relay to board edge)

    Possibly also driven by a REV2/REVxxx
